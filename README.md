Mini17 - QRP M17 handheld

# About
The first handheld to suport M17 was our own TR-9. Unfortunately, the design had a minor flaw in the RF part and was very hard to assemble. After that, we tried modifying various radios with different outcomes. This is our new device - the **Mini17**. It's built around a CC1200 RF chip, which does great job at receiving and transmiting M17 signals. The power output is limited to 16dBm (40mW), so it's a QRP radio. The idea is to build a small radio first and then add RF power amplifier stage later. A *Proof of Concept*, if you will. The design could even be extended to a mobile rig in the future.

# Hardware
The RF chip used is CC1200, MCU is STM32F427ZGT6. OLED display will probably be the same as in Module17.

# Firmware
OpenRTX - the Linux of amateur radio!
